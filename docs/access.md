## Important URLs

These network addresses connect to the cluster management nodes.

## Shell Access

Users can directly connect to the management nodes and and open a command line interface.

Connect with **ssh**.

```
    $ ssh username@shell.rosie.msoe.edu
```

Windows command prompt and powershell do not include ssh by default. An easy way to get the ssh program is to download and install GIT. The included git bash terminal program has a ssh command.
